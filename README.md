# **Project overall introduction**

We were inspired to create a platform that simplifies blockchain interactions for users, especially those who might not have a deep understanding of technical blockchain concepts. Our goal was to leverage AI to make actions like swapping and staking intuitive, opening up new and more accessible experiences on the NEAR blockchain.

## **Project Background**

We used an advanced AI model integrated with the NEAR blockchain, training it to understand and interact with the smart contracts required for swapping and staking. The AI was fine-tuned to handle common blockchain actions and was programmed to communicate directly with NEAR’s protocols. This enables a seamless, easy-to-use interface where users can initiate actions in just a few clicks.

## **Problem to be Solved**
Currently, developers face several problems:

1. **Difficulties of new users in the NEAR ecosystem:** New users may struggle to navigate the NEAR ecosystem due to its complexity and the steep learning curve required to understand blockchain technology.
2. **It is difficult to distinguish the origin of the dapp:** Identifying the origin of a decentralized application (dapp) can be challenging, making it hard for users to trust the application and its creators.
3. **Difficulty in understanding the mechanisms that dapps implement:** The inner workings of dapps can be difficult to comprehend, even for experienced developers, due to the intricate nature of blockchain technology and smart contracts.

## **Project Overview**
Buildlink is a platform designed to simplify blockchain interactions for users, especially those without in-depth technical knowledge of blockchain. Our goal is to leverage artificial intelligence to make actions like swapping and staking intuitive, opening up new and more accessible experiences on the NEAR blockchain.

Features:

- **Chat with AI to receive guidance information:** Users can chat with the AI to receive guidance and information on how to use the platform and its features.
- **Interact with dapps on the AI ​​platform itself:** The platform allows users to directly interact with decentralized applications (dapps) without needing to leave the platform.

### How Buildlink work? 

- ***User Input:*** Users enter their requests into the system.
- ***AI Processing & Chat Generation:*** The AI system processes the requests and generates responses.
- ***Run & Interact with DAPP:*** Users can run and interact with decentralized applications (dapps) directly on the platform.
